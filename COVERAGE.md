# 🗣 Translated? - Haan, *Google Translate* Ne Kiya Hai.

Welcome to the glamorous world of **ForgeIndia** translations — where we count how many of those magical native functions actually got translated into *apni bhasha*.

## What is this file?

This masterpiece logs how many ForgeScript functions you’ve *so lovingly* translated, and which ones you conveniently *forgot* about. Because who doesn’t want to see how far off we are from *total* Hinglish glory?

## How to read this?

- **Total ForgeScript Functions:** The big scary number of all native functions you could possibly translate.
- **Translated:** How many you actually bothered to translate.
- **Coverage:** The percentage of functions translated — or in other words, how much effort you *didn't* put in.
- **Missed functions:** The ones missing from your translations, which might make your script go “uh oh.”

## Why care?

Because knowing your coverage is the first step to pretending you’re actually making progress!

### Quick Tips to Boost Your "Coverage":

- Open those JSON files in `/translations` and add more translations — it's just a text file, not rocket science.
- Spell correctly — our script even suggests “Did you mean?” for your misspelled function names. Yes, we’re thoughtful like that.
- Keep trying. Rome wasn’t built in a day, but maybe your translation coverage can be.

Happy translating! Or not. We don’t judge.
