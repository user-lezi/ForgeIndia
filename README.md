**Your code, your accent, your rules.**

## ✨ Features

* 🔤 Code in **Hinglish** (Hindi + English)
* 🤝 Beginner-friendly for native Hindi speakers
* 🧠 Focus on logic, not *angrezi*
* 🚀 Works just like native ForgeScript — only chattier

---

## 🚀 Example

`index.js`:

```js
const { ForgeIndia } = require("forge.india");
const { ForgeClient } = require("@tryforge/forgescript");

const client = new ForgeClient({
  intents: ["Guilds", "MessageContent", "GuildMessages"],
  events: ["ready", "messageCreate"],
  mobile: true,
  useInviteSystem: true,
  prefixes: ["!", "<@$botID>"],
  extensions: [new ForgeIndia()],
});

client.login("bot token");
```

`commands/test.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: "up",
  type: "messageCreate",
  code: `$!msgReactionAddKaro[$chnlID;$msgID;👍]`
};
```

Yes, it works. No, you don't need a dictionary.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install https://github.com/user-lezi/ForgeIndia
```

You’re one `npm install` away from coding in your *apni bhasha*.

---

## 🧠 Why?

Because `"sendMessage"` doesn't vibe the same as `"msgBhej"`.
Because accessibility isn't just about screen readers — it's about *language* too.
Because *English* shouldn't be a blocker to *logic*.
